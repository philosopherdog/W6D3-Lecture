I started today be showing how to use playgrounds to load a view controller to display an image loaded locally. We then worked on URLSession to make a network request for an image that we displayed. The request used a callback completion handler. I showed how to handle errors, and how to use the defer statement for calling the completion handler.

Next I went over a bunch of things related to the assignment today. I live coded a project found in QuotePro2 folder that demonstrates the following:

1. how to load a view from a Xib file.
2. how to do a callback from a subview to the view controller using target action.
3. how to create a UIActivityViewController.
4. how to override UIButton and create a custom round button with a vector PDF image created in Sketch.
5. how to create an IBDesignable class with IBInspectable properties that you can set in storyboard to view the custom changes to an overridden UIButton.
6. how to post to social media using UIActivityViewController.
7. how to take a snapshot of a xib file to post to social media.

Please see the code in the folder `MyPropertyAnimator` to view the new property animator API, which you should prefer over UIView animations.

Finally, for those interested I have included the slides for core animation and a playground that shows a few animations. See the playground in folder:  `W6D3-CoreAnimation-playground`, and the pdf called `W6D3 - Core Animation`.
